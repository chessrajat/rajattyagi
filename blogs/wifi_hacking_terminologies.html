        wi-fi hacking - Basic Terminologies
      </h1>
      <p>
        With the growing popularity of Wi-Fi and its increasing prominence in
        corporate networks, it is important to understand the various terms,
        acronyms, and standards that are rapidly becoming a part of the lingo.
        To that end, we’ve put together this glossary of common terms that are
        used.

        that Wi-Fi devices can coexist in the same UNII frequency ranges as
        other 5 GHz devices.
      </p>
      <h2 id="i">802.11i</h2>
      <p>
        The IEEE standard for wireless networking security, using AES
        encryption, authentication using 802.1x, and data integrity.
      </p>
      <h2 id="j">802.11j</h2>

      <h2 id="n">802.11n</h2>
      <p>
        The IEEE standard for wireless networking that can use both the 2.4 GHz
        and 5 GHz ranges, with MIMO. 802.11n compatible access points and
        clients can support throughput rates of up to 600 Mbps, and clients are
        backwards compatible with older access points that can only do 802.11 a,
        b, or g.
      </p>
      <h2 id="x">802.1x</h2>
      <p>
        An IEEE standard for port-based authentication to the network. It can be
        used in Ethernet switches to restrict access to the wired network as
        well as in wireless access points to restrict access to the Wi-Fi
        network. 802.1x can use username/password or certificates to
        authenticate to the network. It is typically used in combination with
        wireless encryption schemes to provide confidentiality and integrity.
      </p>
      <h2 id="access-point">Access Point</h2>
      <p>
        A device that acts as the bridge between wireless clients and the wired
        network. Often abbreviated as AP.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ad-hoc-mode">Ad Hoc Mode</h2>
      <p>
        A peer to peer mode of networking using Wi-Fi networking but no access
        point. Ad Hoc networks can include more than two devices.
      </p>
      <h2 id="aes">AES</h2>
      <p>
        The Advanced Encryption Standard is a symmetric block encryption
        protocol used in WPA2 and other protocols to encrypt data with a high
        degree of protection and a low CPU overhead.
      </p>
      <h2 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h2>
      <p>
        Combining multiple channels (even across bands) to obtain higher overall
        throughput. See also channel bonding.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ap">AP</h2>
      <p>Abbreviation for Access Point.</p>
      <h2 id="association">Association</h2>
      <p>
        The process a client goes through to begin exchanging data with an
        Access Point. A client will listen for beacons from an AP for the SSID
        that it wants to use, and then will exchange hello packets with the AP
        with the strongest signal and/or supported data rates. Association can
        be open, or can require a pre-shared key. Once associated, the client
        may be required to successfully authenticate before the AP will pass
        data between the client and the rest of the network.
      </p>
      <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        A client may be required to authenticate to the wireless network before
        it can pass data between itself and other hosts. Authentication can be
        open, but can also require a certificate, username/password, or
        pre-shared key.
      </p>
      <h2 id="beacon">Beacon</h2>
      <p>
        A beacon is transmitted by an AP ten times per second, and advertises
        the existence of the AP on a particular channel or channels. It includes
        information needed by clients to associate and may include the ESSID,
        the supported channels and data rates, and whether it is open or
        requires authentication.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
      <p>
        A standard for short range wireless connectivity between devices, used
        with mice, keyboards, mobile phones, printers, speakers, and more.
        Bluetooth uses frequencies in the same ISM band as 802.11b and g Wi-Fi
        networks.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bridge">Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        A network device that interconnects two dissimilar network types. An AP
        can act as a bridge between the wired and wireless networks, but can
        also serve as a wireless connection between two wired segments. See
        Workgroup Bridge.
      </p>
      <h2 id="bssid">BSSID</h2>
      <p>
        BSSID stands for Basic Service Set Identifier and is the MAC address of
        the AP.
      </p>
      <h2 id="captive-portal">Captive Portal</h2>
      <p>
        In wireless networking, a captive portal is a process running on an AP
        that can intercept and redirect clients who have associated to a web
        page where they must agree to terms of service, provide a password, or
        even purchase access. These are common in hotels, airports, guest
        networks, and other locations that offer Internet access but want to
        charge a fee, restrict it to authorized users, or require the user to
        accept their AUP. See hotspot.
      </p>
      <h2 id="channel">Channel</h2>
      <p>
        A channel is the network path for wireless transmissions. Each Wi-Fi
        standard has numerous channels, each of which is a central frequency.
        There are 11 channels in 802.11b and g networks in the United States and
        Canada; 14 in most other countries. There are 9 channels in 802.11a
        networks in the United States, with various counts for other regions of
        the world. Some countries including the US can have additional channels
        in the 5 GHz range if they employ DFS. Channels have a bandwidth-the
        greater the bandwidth, the greater the potential throughput. See 20 MHz
        and 40 MHz channels.
      </p>
      <h2 id="channel-bonding">Channel Bonding</h2>
      <p>
        In 802.11b and g networks, multiple channels can be combined to obtain
        greater throughput when all access points and clients can support it.
        See also aggregation.
      </p>
      <h2 id="closed-network">Closed Network</h2>
      <p>
        A closed network requires users to have authentication information
        before they can get onto the network.
      </p>
      <h2 id="collision-avoidance">Collision Avoidance</h2>
      <p>
        Collision avoidance (CA) is the method wireless devices typically employ
        to ensure data transmissions do not interfere with others. CA schemes
        can use a Clear to Send/Ready to Send (CTS/RTS) scheme where they signal
        readiness to transmit data, but must wait to be acknowledged by a
        central controller (AP) before transmitting actual data. Contrast this
        with Ethernet and its collision detection (CD) scheme where hosts
        transmit and then listen to see if others are also transmitting, and
        then sending a jamming signal to indicate a collision, and falling back
        a random period of time before trying again.
      </p>
      <h2 id="concurrent-operation">Concurrent Operation</h2>
      <p>
        Also called Dual Band, APs that can use both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands are
        capable of concurrent operation. These can offer 802.11n capabilities to
        compatible clients while also servicing legacy clients using 802.11 b,
        g, and a.
      </p>
      <h2 id="direct-sequence-spread-spectrum-dsss">
        Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
      </h2>
      <p>
        DSSS is the modulation technique used by 802.11b networks to transmit
        data. It is resistant to interference, and permits sharing of a channel
        amongst multiple purposes, however it requires more bandwidth to
        transmit than the actual data being transmitted.
      </p>
      <h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
      <p>
        Using multiple antennae to reduce interference and improve both
        transmission and reception of signals.
      </p>
      <h2 id="dual-band">Dual-band</h2>
      <p>See Concurrent Operation.</p>
      <h2 id="eap">EAP</h2>
      <p>
        The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) can be used to provide
        authentication to the wireless network when employing WPA-Enterprise and
        WPA2-Enterprise.
      </p>
      <h2 id="eap-fast">EAP-FAST</h2>
      <p>
        EAP-FAST is Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication
        via Secure Tunneling. It is one possible EAP scheme used in wireless
        networks for authentication. It is being promoted by Cisco as a
        replacement for LEAP.
      </p>
      <h2 id="eap-tls">EAP-TLS</h2>
      <p>
        EAP-TLS is Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security.
        It is one possible EAP scheme used in wireless networks for
        authentication, and uses client certificates. It is widely deployed
        across most major Wi-Fi vendors.
      </p>
      <h2 id="eap-ttlsms-chapv2">EAP-TTLS/MS-CHAPv2</h2>
      <p>
        EAP-TTLS/MS-CHAPv2 is Extensible Authentication Protocol-Tunneled TLS
        using MSCHAPv2. It is one possible EAP scheme used in wireless networks
        for authentication, and uses a username/password (typically
        authenticated by Active Directory) to provide authentication.
      </p>
      <h2 id="essid">ESSID</h2>
      <p>
        The Extended Service Set Identifier is the “name” of the wireless
        network, and is used by all APs that provide access to the same
        infrastructure in an ESS. It can be advertised by APs in their beacons,
        or suppressed so that clients must ‘know’ the ESSID before associating
        with an AP. See ESS.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ess">ESS</h2>
      <p>
        An extended service set (ESS) refers to a network with two or more APs
        working cooperatively. They share access to the same VLAN, use the same
        SSID, and can support fast handoff between clients that move from the
        coverage range of one AP to another.
      </p>
      <h2 id="frequency-hopping-spread-spectrum-fhss">
        Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
      </h2>
      <p>
        FHSS is the modulation technique used by Bluetooth and other
        technologies that use the same frequency ranges as 802.11 networks.
        Transmissions hop across multiple frequencies several times per second,
        and can work well at short ranges even in the presence of multiple
        competing systems trying to use the same frequency ranges.
      </p>
      <h2 id="hotspot">Hotspot</h2>
      <p>
        An AP set up specifically to provide Internet access to users. Hotspots
        are popular in coffee shops, restaurants, and other publicly accessible
        locations, and usually do not require any authentication or offer any
        encryption. They provide the convenience of free Internet access to
        attract customers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ism-band">ISM Band</h2>
      <p>
        The Industrial, Scientific, and Medical frequency bands are unlicensed
        bands used by a variety of devices for wireless connectivity. In the 2.4
        GHz ISM band, 802.11b and g network devices, Bluetooth devices, NFC
        devices, baby monitors, and microwave ovens all compete for bandwidth.
      </p>
      <h2 id="lightweight-extensible-authentication-protocol">
        Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol
      </h2>
      <p>
        LEAP was developed by Cisco to provide authentication to networks using
        WEP for encryption. It is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and has been
        replaced by EAP-FAST.
      </p>
      <h2 id="mac-address-filtering">MAC Address Filtering</h2>
      <p>
        An approach to restricting access to a wireless network by only
        permitting clients to connect if their MAC address is on a list. MAC
        address filtering is not scalable, and since most wireless NICs can be
        configured to use any MAC, easily defeated by anyone within range that
        can pick up transmissions from an authorized client and simply use their
        MAC address.
      </p>
      <h2 id="mimo">MIMO</h2>
      <p>
        Multiple Input/Multiple Output signaling that uses several transceivers
        and antennae to improve throughput and range of the wireless network.
        Both APs and clients can use MIMO, though it is most often a feature of
        APs.
      </p>
      <h2 id="network-name">Network Name</h2>
      <p>See ESSID and SSID.</p>
      <h2 id="nfc">NFC</h2>
      <p>
        Near Field Communication is a technology used most often with mobile
        devices to exchange data based on proximity, or even physical contact.
        NFC technology is being built into mobile phones for data transfer,
        touch to pay technologies, and smartcard reading. NFC is also being
        incorporated into some APs to make setting up a client easier. See WPS.
      </p>
      <h2 id="ofdm">OFDM</h2>
      <p>
        Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing is used by 802.11a, g, n, and
        ac standards using multiple carrier frequencies. It is especially useful
        at obtaining higher throughput and overcoming interference in discrete
        frequencies.
      </p>
      <h2 id="open-network">Open Network</h2>
      <p>
        An open wireless network permits association and authentication without
        requiring a passphrase, certificate, or credentials. Open networks are
        often called hotspots and provide free Internet access to anyone within
        range. Many coffee shops and restaurants will deploy these to attract
        customers. They may still incorporate a captive portal. See hotspots.
      </p>
      <h2 id="passphrase">Passphrase</h2>
      <p>
        A password or combination of words used to provide authentication to a
        wireless network WEP uses fixed 40 or 104 bit passphrases, while WPA and
        WPA2 can use arbitrary length passphrases.
      </p>
      <h2 id="pre-shared-key">Pre-shared Key</h2>
      <p>
        A pre-shared key (PSK) is a passphrase that is shared ahead of need.
        PSKs are typically used in WEP, WPA, and WPA2 protected networks, where
        each client that wishes to join the network has the same PSK.
      </p>
      <h2 id="qos">QoS</h2>
      <p>
        Quality of Service enables networks to prioritize certain traffic types
        above others, so that things which are mission critical or latency
        sensitive gain preferred access to the network over things that are
        lower priority or can tolerate delay. This is especially useful in Wi-Fi
        networks using voice or video; the quality of both suffer when
        encountering latency. APs that offer QoS can provide more access to
        clients that need it than to those that do not. See 802.11d.
      </p>
      <h2 id="range">Range</h2>
      <p>
        The distance between an AP and a client (or between two APs, see
        Workgroup Bridge) over which Wi-Fi transmissions can be successful. The
        greater the range, the greater the attenuation of a signal and the lower
        the overall throughput will be.
      </p>
      <h2 id="repeater">Repeater</h2>
      <p>
        A wireless network device that receives signals and retransmits them,
        without providing direct access to the wired network. Repeaters are
        typically used to increase the range wireless networks can cover.
      </p>
      <h2 id="roaming">Roaming</h2>
      <p>
        In a wireless network with multiple APs, a client that is moving from
        the coverage area provided by one AP to that provided by another is
        roaming. It must disassociate from the first AP before it can associate
        to the next AP.
      </p>
      <h2 id="rogue">Rogue</h2>
      <p>
        A rogue client is one that attempts or succeeds in accessing a wireless
        network without authority to do so. A rogue AP is one installed onto the
        wired network without authority, and can be a maliciously placed device
        by someone attempting to penetrate the network, or by a non-malicious
        user who simply wanted to get wireless access to the wired network but
        did not involve IT or go through appropriate processes.
      </p>
      <h2 id="router">Router</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of SOHO, a wireless router is an AP that also performs
        Internet connection sharing, and can run a DHCP service, a captive
        portal service,
      </p>
      <h2 id="ssid">SSID</h2>
      <p>
        The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the wireless network.
        It can be contained in the beacons sent out by APs, or it can be
        ‘hidden’ so that clients who wish to associate must first know the name
        of the network. Early security guidance was to hide the SSID of your
        network, but modern networking tools can detect the SSID by simply
        watching for legitimate client association, as SSIDs are transmitted in
        cleartext.
      </p>
      <h2 id="tkip">TKIP</h2>
      <p>
        The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol was developed as a replacement for
        WEP but is no longer considered secure and has been removed from 802.11
        standards. See WPA.
      </p>
      <h2 id="tls">TLS</h2>
      <p>
        Transport Layer Security is a protocol designed to encrypt and
        authenticate all kinds of network traffic at the transport layer, and is
        the successor to SSL. It uses certificates to exchange public keys,
        which are then used to encrypt session keys.
      </p>
      <h2 id="unii-band">UNII Band</h2>
      <p>
        The Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure radio bands include
        frequencies in the 5 GHz range used by 802.11a, n, and ac standards.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wap">WAP</h2>
      <p>
        WAP can refer to the Wireless Application Protocol, or can be used to
        mean Wireless Access Point.
      </p>
      <h2 id="war-chalking">War Chalking</h2>
      <p>
        War chalking is a hobbyist pursuit using sidewalk chalk to “mark” areas
        of wireless network access. War chalking uses a series of pictograms or
        icons to represent open and closed networks, and includes the SSID and
        sometimes the information needed to access the network.
      </p>
      <h2 id="war-driving">War Driving</h2>
      <p>
        Another hobbyist pursuit, war drivers will use their cars, wireless
        equipment, and mapping software to map out the wireless coverage of an
        area. Some groups have collaborated to map out entire cities. The
        resulting map may be shared amongst group members or published to the
        Internet and will identify, as closely as possible, the location of APs,
        their SSIDs, and whether the networks are open or closed.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wep">WEP</h2>
      <p>
        Wired Equivalent Privacy is the original encryption scheme implemented
        in wireless networks. Using RC4 and either a 40bit or 104 bit pre-shared
        key, WEP provides about the same level of privacy as using a hub does on
        a wired network. Easily broken, WEP is typically only deployed in home
        networks.

      <h2 id="wimax">WiMax</h2>
      <p>
        The WAN or community deployment of wireless networking, WiMax was
        initially started by Intel and is now designated by the IEEE as 802.16.
        WiMax offers ranges measured in miles and bandwidth of up to 1 Gbps.
        WiMax deployments are limited at present, but can include last mile
        services, regional mesh networks, and municipal access for entire
        cities.

      <h2 id="workgroup-bridge">Workgroup Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        A pair of APs that provide connectivity between two different wireless
        segments are a workgroup bridge. Entire offices can be connected
        wirelessly using workgroup bridges, or small office on another floor of
        a building, or across the street from the main office, may be connected
        using workgroup bridges rather than by running cables. These are
        extremely popular in downtown areas where offices are spread out across
        multiple buildings that are still close together, and where the cost of
        running fibre or copper cables is excessive.

      <h2 id="wpa">WPA</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi Protected Access is a security protocol for wireless networks that
        was designed to replace WEP. It uses TKIP to encrypt data and is much
        more resistant to attacks that WEP is, but still has cryptographic
        vulnerabilities that make it undesirable for use. WPA was an IEEE
        802.11i draft. WPA Personal typically uses an initial PSK to establish
        authentication, but the protocol has been extended to use EAP methods
        where available.
      </p>
      <h2 id="wpa2">WPA2</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi Protected Access v2 is currently the strongest encryption protocol
        available to wireless networks, and is the current 802.11i standard. It
        uses AES encryption for data and is considered cryptographically strong.
        WPA2 Personal uses a PSK to establish initial authentication, but WPA2
        Enterprise can use various EAP methods to ensure a strong authentication
        without the need for a PSK.

      <h2 id="wps">WPS</h2>
      <p>
        Wi-Fi Protected Setup makes it easier for users to add Wi-Fi clients to
        WPA and WPA2 protected wireless networks. It was intended to help
        non-technical home users deploy WPA security, but is vulnerable to a
        brute-force attack and should not be used. WPS can use a PSK, encryption
        settings transferred using a USB key, a PIN, NFC, or with a simple push
        button approach.
